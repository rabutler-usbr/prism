\title{Stack prism data}
\usage{
pd_stack(pd)

prism_stack(prismfile)
}
\arguments{
\item{pd, prismfile}{A vector of prism data returned by \code{\link[=prism_archive_ls]{prism_archive_ls()}}
or \code{\link[=prism_archive_subset]{prism_archive_subset()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{RasterStack} object. Raster layers are stacked in the order they
are provided in \code{pd}.
}
\description{
\code{pd_stack()} creates a raster stack from prism data. It is up to the user to
ensure that \code{pd} is of the expected variable and temporal period, i.e., the
function does no checking and will stack data with different variables or
temporal periods.

\code{prism_stack()} is the deprecated version of \code{pd_stack()}.
